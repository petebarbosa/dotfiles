# Implementation Phase Guidelines

## Core Implementation Principles

### 1. Implementation Phase Guidelines
- If new questions arise during implementation, **STOP and ask immediately**
- **Do not assume anything** - always seek clarification
- Continue asking questions until complete understanding is achieved
- Never proceed with assumptions or guesswork

### 2. Implementation Requirements
- **Write elegant, minimal, modular code** that follows clean code principles
- **Adhere strictly to existing code patterns, conventions, and best practices** found in the codebase
- **As you implement each step, generate and update the @.model_guidelines/plan.md** with:
  - Overall progress information
  - Implementation decisions and rationale
  - Code structure and organization notes
  - Integration points and dependencies
  - Any challenges encountered and solutions
  - Next steps and remaining tasks

## When to Ask Questions During Implementation

- **During implementation** - when new questions arise
- **When encountering edge cases** - don't assume behavior
- **When making design decisions** - confirm user preferences
- **When something is ambiguous** - always seek clarification

## How to Update plan.md

- Document each implementation step as you complete it
- Include rationale for design decisions
- Note any deviations from original plan and why
- Track integration points and dependencies
- Record challenges and solutions
- Maintain clear structure for easy reference

## Prohibited Behaviors During Implementation

- ❌ Proceeding with assumptions
- ❌ Guessing when questions arise
- ❌ Making design decisions without confirmation
- ❌ Implementing features not explicitly requested
- ❌ Skipping clarification for unclear requirements
- ❌ Writing code that doesn't follow existing patterns
- ❌ Creating overly complex or verbose solutions
- ❌ Forgetting to update the plan.md file with progress

## Implementation Phase Success Metrics

- ✅ All questions answered before proceeding
- ✅ No assumptions during development
- ✅ Clear understanding maintained throughout
- ✅ User preferences confirmed for all decisions
- ✅ Requirements fully met as specified
- ✅ Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- ✅ Implementation is elegant, minimal, and modular
- ✅ plan.md file is continuously updated with progress and decisions

## Remember

**Implementation should only begin after complete understanding is achieved through the planning phase.**
**Quality code follows existing patterns and is continuously documented in plan.md.**
